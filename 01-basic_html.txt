Download and install a text editor. Any editor will do for now even notepad.
I suggest Sublime Text. Download at: http://www.sublimetext.com

Open it up and type in the code below.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Basic HTML Template</title>
<!-- This is a comment tag. These will not affect webpage appearance --!>
<!-- Title tags set the title of the webpage in the browser tab --!>
</head>
<body>

This is my first web page!

<h1>H1, H2, H3, H4 tags increase font-size</h1>

<strong>Strong tags bold text.</strong>

<em>Em tags italicize text.</em>

Most tags must have an open and closing tag. But not always.

<br>br tags stand for "break." It will start a new line.

<p>The "p" tag will start a new line with space above and below it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>This is an unordered-list.</li>
  <li>This is the 2nd list element.</li>
  <li>This is the 3rd.</li>
</ul>

<table>
  <tr>
    <!-- tr stands for table row --!>
    <td>This is a table cell.</td>
    <td>These cells are in the same row.
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <!-- This is the start of a new row --!>
    <td>This is a table cell in the 2nd row.</td>
    <td>This cell is in the 2nd row.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

</body>
</html>
