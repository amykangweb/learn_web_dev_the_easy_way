Introduction

This series of tutorials will give absolute beginners a crash course in web development. I will try to keep each tutorial as simple and concise as possible. I will not explain everything. I will only teach you the absolute basics you need to know to get started.

This project is a distillation of the most essential things I've learned about web development. I hope it saves beginners a lot of the headaches, confusion, and trial and error I experienced while teaching myself code.

If you want to learn more about something, it's up to you to search forums, books, and tutorials for more information.

I welcome feedback, suggestions, and corrections on my tutorial.

I will periodically edit and update this project as needed.

Thanks and enjoy!
