If you don't know what the command line is, look it up right now and read a
little about it before starting this tutorial.

I will teach you my most frequently used commands.

For Windows users please download and use Git Bash at:

Type each of these commands into the command line and hit enter.

When you open the terminal you will automatically start in your home directory.
To get back to the home directory at anytime, type in cd and hit enter.

To navigate into a folder in your current location, enter cd and the folder
name.

mkdir <foldername>

If you wish to create a new directory/folder in your current location.

touch <filename>

If you wish to create a new file in your current location.

mv <filename> <new filename>

This will rename your file if not given a new location.

mv <filename> <new location>

This will move your file to the new location. Example: mv file.html new_folder/
This command will move your file into new_folder.

This will remove the corresponding file in the current directory.
